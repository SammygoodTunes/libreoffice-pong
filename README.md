# libreoffice-pong

This crappy version of Pong was tested on LibreOffice 7.2.7.2.M7 (x64).

To set it up, all you need to do is open the Macro Editor in `Tools > Macros > Edit Macros`, then when the window shows up, go to `File > Import Basic` and select the `main.bas` file in the repository.

Run the file and the game should begin playing. It's fairly buggy and isn't really impressive performance-wise. Do with this what you will.
