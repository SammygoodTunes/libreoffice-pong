# libreoffice-pong

This crappy version of Pong was tested on LibreOffice 7.2.7.2.M7 (x64). It was originally made in 3 hours as a way to learn about how these Macros work and to understand the VBA language better.

To set it up, if you dare, all you need to do is open the Macro Editor in `Tools > Macros > Edit Macros`, then when the window shows up, go to `File > Import Basic` and select the `main.bas` file in the repository.

Run the file and the game should show a dialog box telling you how to start the game.

It's fairly buggy and isn't really impressive performance-wise. Do with this what you will.
